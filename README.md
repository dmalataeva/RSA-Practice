# RSA-Practice

Simple script used to generate very large RSA keys and encrypt/decrypt messages in ASCII.

This was made as a bonus assignment for Martin Pei's Discrete Mathematics course at the University of Waterloo.

This will not run as a standalone, it is rather intended to use as a reference on a very simple method of RSA mathematic principles.

However, upon running the program with all variables configured, it will prompt you to either generate a key, decrypt or encrypt a message. If you choose to generate a key, bear in mind that keys are not dynamically assigned to current users, but simply outputted. So in order to continue encrypting/decrypting, you will have to hardcode your keys into the script.
Unfortunately, I do not see any use or have any will to continue refining this project, so it will probably be left as it is.
Feel free to use it if you want to generate and use 600+ digit RSA keys.
It was also something I made in one night for bonus marks, so please don't judge the level of organization. :)
