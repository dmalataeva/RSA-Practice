# RSA-Practice

Simple script used to generate very large RSA keys and encrypt/decrypt messages in ASCII.

This was made as a bonus assignment for a Discrete Mathematics course at the University of Waterloo.

The script is intended to be used as a simple reference for RSA implementation.

Upon running the program with all variables configured, it will prompt you to either generate a key, decrypt or encrypt a message. If you choose to generate a key, the entire string will be outputted. Once that is done, you can hardcode your keys into the program to use it for decryption/encryption of messages.
Unfortunately, I do not see any use or have any will to continue refining this project, so it will probably be left as it is.
Feel free to use it if you want to generate and use 600+ digit RSA keys. :)
